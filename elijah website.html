<h1>work that i have done</h1>
<h1>unit 15 documentation work</h1>  

 Elijah Robinson 

Unit 15 documentation


The task that i was meant to do in a team of seven was to make a website that meet the requirements of the website that was given to us. The company that we were making the website for is called the Green Foundation. My role was to create a blog, create a footer,create a button so the user can subscribe to the blog and to review my part of the website and design a homepage template. I also created a different theme with some new ideas on it that i suggested should go on the website to make the website seem more professional


To create the blog what i had to do was take the blog from the Green Foundation website and take it a put it into my blog. Next i added a background colour to the blog page. I choose to use the colour  because my group decided that the background colour of the site would be green so i kept with the theme of the website and went with that colour. The next thing i did on the blog page was create a subscribe button. This was made so that the client or the person that is using the website can subscribe  to a weekly so that they can always keep up to date with the charity and what they are doing. We put this page into our website because it was one on the website brief that this page would be one of the pages that the charity wanted on its website 


To create the footer for the website i looked at templates for different footers and selected the one that looked the best for the website. Then i edited the the footer so it would have the right information on it. I then placed it on the foot of the website.


To create the subscribe button what i did was make take a code from another website that had the code to make a button. Then i put a message on the button so the user of the website would know that is is the button to subscribe to the blog. The person who would then get weekly updates because the blog is a weekly blog so they will get a update to one a new blog has been put up.


The last thing that i made was a different website design called “elijah-theme-testing” i made this as  alternative design to the one that we were currently using . i also did this so i could develop my own skills in how to code as well. I suggested that we should use the icons that were on the template to help get our website up to a better standard.


Another thing i learned to do was use the github repository and push and pull my work so it can go on the repository and other people in my group can view it. I also learned and improved my coding skills.

My group and i made important design decision when making our website. One of the most important decision that we had to make was the colour of the website. As the charity that we were making the site for was called the Green Foundation we decided to make the main colour of the website green. We also created paper design for the pages which can be seen under the heading screenshots.

Unit 15  blog


In unit 15 i have learned to use github and gitkrakern. I have used them to pull and push my work up to the repository. This has been very useful to me because i now know how to use it just in case i go into a job that needs me to do something like that. I still need to improve on how to use it but i believe i know the basic. I have also learned to clone my repository and view it on a web browser. In this unit i have also learned to code basic things. For example on the website for unit 15 i made the blog and the subscribe button for the blog. I also during the work got a template from a different website and made a different theme to the website that we handed in.    there was also some parts of my website template that i suggested would be good for the website. For example my website template had icons on it so i suggested to the team that we put that on the website. I have also learned to work in a team and improve my skills in communication and teamwork. I believe that i have improved those skills. As this is the first unit i have done and the first time i have had to work in a team on a project it has been the hardest but as we work on more task together. One of the hardest parts of the project was the report that you had to do at the end. There was a lot to write about
