Unit 15 documentation


The task that i was meant to do in a team of sven was to make a website that meet the requirements of the website that was given to us. The company that we were making the website for is called the Green Foundation. My role was to create a blog, create a footer,create a button so the user can subscribe to the blog and to review my part of the website and design a homepage template. I also created a different theme with some new ideas on it that i suggested should go on the website to make the website seem more professional.



To create the blog what i had to do was take the blog from the Green Foundation website and take it a put it into my blog. Next i added a background colour to the blog page. I choose to use the colour  because my group decided that the background colour of the site would be green so i kept with the theme of the website and went with that colour. The next thing i did on the blog page was create a subscribe button. This was made so that the client or the person that is using the website can subscribe  to a weekly so that they can always keep up to date with the charity and what they are doing. We put this page into our website because it was one on the website brief that this page would be one of the pages that the charity wanted on its website


To create the footer for the website i looked at templates for different footers and selected the one that looked the best for the website. Then i edited the the footer so it would have the right information on it. I then placed it on the foot of the website.


To create the subscribe button what i did was make take a code from another website that had the code to make a button. Then i put a message on the button so the user of the website would know that is is the button to subscribe to the blog. The person who would then get weekly updates because the blog is a weekly blog so they will get a update to one a new blog has been put up.


The last thing that i made was a different website design called “elijah-theme-testing” i made this as  alternative design to the one that we were currently using . i also did this so i could develop my own skills in how to code as well. I suggested that we should use the icons that were on the template to help get our website up to a better standard.


Another thing i learned to do was use the github repository and push and pull my work so it can go on the repository and other people in my group can view it. I also learned and improved my coding skills.

My group and i made important design decision when making our website. One of the most important decision that we had to make was the colour of the website. As the charity that we were making the site for was called the Green Foundation we decided to make the main colour of the website green. We also created paper design for the pages which can be seen under the heading screenshots.


We meet the client requirements for the donate online requirement by putting a donate button on our requirements website that is also linked to a paypal login account so the user can donate online to the charity. The user can also donate on the homepage as well by putting in their email and password.we also created a newsletter. This was one of the client requirements, and we optimize them to by making a button that makes the user subscribe to the newsletter which means that more people will subscribe to the blog. I created the blog and made a button for the blog. This optimize the blog because the user we be regularly updated with what the charity is doing and therefore they will be more likely to donate which is what the charity wants. We also put a twitter feed on the homepage of the website so that the user of the website can keep up with what the charity is doing. We have also made a shop where people can buy items off our website. The tab is page that you can buy items off the website is called shop. The user will click on the buy now link and it will take them to a website where they can then buy the item that they want. this is link to the user requirements because one of the user  was to have a page where the user can Purchase our merchandise and we have meet this requirement by having a page where the user can buy items online.we also made a blog comments section where the user can contribute blog comments to the blog. This was one of the user requirements as the owners of the website wanted the users to Contribute blog comments.


We have created awareness of the organization by creating a twitter page for the website. This generate awareness because twitter is one of the biggest social media platforms out there and this will differently raise away awareness of the website.we have generated sales by having a shop page on our website which have a range of different items on them.

Unit Introduction: the purpose of this unit is to understand the principles of website development.incresingly, organization rely on website to serve customers and  in some cases, to generate revenue. With millions of web pages being created daily, the need for website to be engaging innovative and desirable is important. As a website developer you use sophicticated techniques to capture interest.

A1-purpose and principles of website products.

The purpose of web products is to get the customer to buy the companies product. This is called E-commerce when a customer buys a companies product or service online. E-commerce is becoming more and more popular in the world today because it means that customer can shop online and not have to go to a store to get the product that they want.




A2- factors affecting website performance.

one factor that effect website performance is the connection speed.there are many different ways that a user can connect to the internet such as dial up broadband, mobile broadband  , and WIFI. Dial up internet access uses public switched telephone network to connect to the internet service providers.the speed of dial up is very slow compared to the other ways that you can connect to the internet and have a good website performance. Broadband is a very high speed connection method. Broadband also allows information to be streamed at a fast rate.broadband is used from telephone cables in a user house. Broadband has a positive effect on the user because websites will load faster which gives for better website performance. moblie broadband is the use of the internet wirelessly. It allows you to use the internet on the go. Mobile broadband is slower because it connects to a seatillete which means that website performance will be slower because the pages on the website will take longer to load. WIFI is one of the most popular ways to connect to the internet because it does not need and wires so you can use it anywhere that has a WIFI. It has good speed so website performance will be very good.

Browser also give a website good performance. You use a browers to search for webpages most companies update the browers which give the user a quiker. loading time which increase website performance.

The content on the website will also effect website speed. If there is a lot of content on a website then the website performance will be slow then a webpage with less content on it.

Bandwidth will also effect the performance of a website because if you have narrow bandwidth then it will that longer for a webpage to load, but if you have wider bandwidth that it will mean that it will be a shorter time for a webpage to load.



P1 GAME AND APPLE


The homepage is welcoming simple and clean, allowing the brand to really show its products off and make them the primary focus. This is actually the main purpose of their website, to sell and advertise their products. 

The design of their homepage has a very effective use of white space that ensures as a customer, your eye is drawn to the product on the image slider. The homepage is relatively short, especially if you ignore the footer and this stops visitors needing to scroll to find what they are looking for. If the page you want isn’t listed in the menu bar, it will likely be in the footer or as a link in the page content.


The apple website is designed for adult so there will not be a lot of colour on the website compared to a toy stores website.



The game website target audience is gamers so they need to advertise the lastest games for people to buy on their website for people to see which they do. Compared to the apple website the game website uses a lot more colour. This is because they are trying to get a younger audience on their website because there are more teenage and young children playing videos games the adults.

M1 

The game website uses a lot of image and colours on their website which they use to advertise the games that they are trying to sell. However the apple website uses less colour because they only use the colour black and white because they are appliing to a different audience of people. The navigation on both website is very easy to do as their search bars are very easy to locate. The purpose of both their websites is to sell and advertise their product which will also get more customers into their stores.

The use of principles of website design are used to produce creative,3 high performance websites which meet client requirements . The layout of both websites is very organinesd as because  apples website has all of its products in rows and colums so the user can easily  through the webpage and see the different product that apple sell very easy. They also have different section for different products for example they have a page for Iphones and they have a different page for their macbooks so it is very easy to pick out what you are looking at.the apple website also has a very quick  Game also has a very simple website as they but their newest games on the home page of the website they have also use many different colours but the main colours  that they use are purple and white. The page loading time are very quick for the customer so it meets client requierments.

Search engine optimastion for apple is very high because if a client searches for products like phones and laptops they will come up first as one of the top websites to go to. Game is also a very popular if the client is looking for games. The apple website has around 67 million people visiting their website a day and the item that the client search for is Iphones so that part of their website is very popular. Both websites do not have a lot of web space on it as they both have a lot of image and information on their websites.

D1

 The purpose of the game websites is to sell games, consoles and gameware that they also sell in their stores or online. The purpose of apples website is to sell the products  that they make both in store so their website is also promoting their and online. The reason why these websites are both high quality websites is because they are both good at selling products online which is their purpose so the websites are both for filling their purpose.

The communication between the website and the client is very good as they both have help pages on their website as they both have help pages on their website so if the customer is stunk online they can go to the help page and get help. This is a feature of a high quality website because they are meeting client requierments and this will help keep customers coming back to their websites.

Navigation on both websites are good and very easy to do. On the apple website there is a search bar at the top of each of the web pages and the same with the game website as well. They both also give suggestion of what the clients to see which saves the client time as well.

The websites are not similar in layout as the apple website is more sturctured compared to the game website
